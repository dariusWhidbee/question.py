# question.py
I will be creating a program that gives the user a one question to take that will consist 
with four answers. This question Is a multiple choice question with four 
answers. The question that is answered will tell the user if he/she got the question right
 or wrong. When this questions is answered the program will tell the user if they got the 
 question right or wrong. Any invalid answers will make the program ask 
the same question over and over again until the correct responce because of the while 
loop.
